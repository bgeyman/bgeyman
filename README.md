### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD Candidate working in the <a href=" https://bgc.seas.harvard.edu/">Biogeochemistry of Global Contaminants</a> Group at Harvard University. I work on the development of global models (GEOS-Chem and GTMM), and apply these models to study the fate of anthropogenic mercury in the environment.
